# Thinkful-Local-Library-Exercise

This is one of the first projects from the thinkful course. 

This application or platform was asked to be created by the neigbhorhood. The neigbhorhood wanted to know certain things about books in the library.

One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

This application uses the find(), filter(), map(), some(), and every() methods to solve different problems.

The application uses the sort() method to sort arrays in various ways.

The application also uses the reduce() method to solve different problems.
